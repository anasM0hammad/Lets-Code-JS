# Lets Code JS
Some of the Basic to Advance Interview Coding Exercises solved using JavaScript.


## How this works
- There are two files in every topic's folder
1. index.js
2. test.js
3. directions.html   (_Not present in every topic_)

 _**directions.html** is present when there is large number of task to perform in the given exercise. Open the file in the browser for all  the task list._

- **index.js** consist of the problem statement as well as the problem solution 
- **test.js** consist of all the test cases for the given problem

## How to run the code

1. run this and install jest
```
npm install --g jest 
```

2. After jest installed we can use jest to run our **test.js** file as test cases for our code in **index.js**
    
    run this command
``` 
jest *FolderName*/test.js -- watch
```
